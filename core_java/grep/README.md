# Introduction

Discuss the design of each app. What does the app do? What technologies have you used? (e.g. core java, libraries, lambda, IDE, docker, etc..)

For this Project I created a grep (regex) style application in Java which is able to parse through a directory of Files, similar to the `grep` linux command which returns matcing strings from files.
